    "# 4. Algorithmic Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Two brilliant strategists, Arya and Mario, are about to play a game with a sequence of numbers. Arya, as player 1, begins the game, while Mario, player 2, plays 2nd. Their goal is clear: to collect the highest possible score by taking numbers from either end of the sequence, one at a time. They will play in perfect synchronicity, each seeking the advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence represented as an array of nums, is laid out in front of them. Arya will start by selecting either the number at the beginning (nums[0]) or the end (nums[nums.length - 1]) of the array, adding that value to her score. This value is then removed from the beginning or the end of nums. Then, it’s Mario’s turn to do the same with the remaining sequence. The game proceeds this way, with each player taking numbers from either end until no numbers are left to claim. The player with the highest score wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if they end in a tie, Arya, as the first to act, will claim victory by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arya is now before you, asking for help to predict her chances. She wants to know, with her best possible choices, whether she can guarantee a win, assuming both players play with perfect skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Help Arya by providing a pseudocode for finding an optimal playing strategy, that is, a strategy that maximizes her value. (Hint: Use recursion, assuming that both players play optimally).\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Write a Python program implementing her game strategy. Try different array lengths to test the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Is the algorithm efficient? Prove that it is polynomial and provide an asymptotic time complexity bound, or show that it requires exponential time.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) If the algorithm is exponential, explain how to make it polynomial and provide a pseudocode for it. Recompute the computational complexity of the updated algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) Implement the algorithm in Python. Compare your result values with the previous algorithm. Also compare the running times.\n",
    "\n",
    "f) Finally, consult LLM (ChatGPT, Claude AI, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.) to craft a third, optimized implementation and analyze its time complexity. Also, explain if the LLM is doing a good job and how you can evaluate whether the suggested solution works properly.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Input 1\n",
    "\n",
    "nums = [1, 5, 2]\n",
    "Output 1\n",
    "\n",
    "false\n",
    "Explanation: Arya’s optimal choices still lead her to a lower score than Mario’s, so she cannot guarantee victory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input 2\n",

    "nums = [1, 5, 233, 7]\n",
    "Output 2\n",

    " The maxDiff function operates in a way that can be visualized as a **binary tree**, where each node represents a state of the game, and the two branches correspond to the two possible choices a player can make (choosing the first number or choosing the last number). The height of the tree is n (the size of the list, as one number is removed at each recursive step). While Total number of nodes in the tree is approximately $2^n$, making the time complexity exponential.\n",

    "\n",
    "-**Optimization:** The suggested solution optimizes the recursive version into a bottom-up dynamic programming approach. This eliminates the overhead of recursive calls and ensures a predictable time complexity of $O(n^2)$.<br>\n",

    "-**Simplicity:** By introducing compact logic for game simulation, the code is easier to follow and debug. For example, the use of a boolean flag (arya_turn) is cleaner and avoids unnecessary string comparisons.<br>\n",
